How to Use RPyG:

MAPS
To create a new map, copy the "testRoom.json" file, then rename the file to your liking and edit the json file as follows:

Inside the "tiles" area, each section is a tile. Here is a guide to editing tiles: 

{
	"x": 40,							<--- This says how many pixels from the left the tile will generate.
	"y": 0,								<--- This says how many pixels from the top the tile will generate.
	"spriteWidth": 40,					<--- This says how wide the tile is.
	"spriteHeight": 40,					<--- This says how tall the tile is.
	"image": "Images/Door.png",			<--- This says what image to use for the tile.
	"passable": true,					<--- This says whether or not the player can walk through the tile.
	"door": true,						<--- This says whether or not the tile will teleport you somewhere else.
	"tpRoom": "Rooms/emptyRoom.json",	<--- ONLY REQUIRED IF DOOR IS TRUE: This says what room to teleport the player to.
	"tpX": 80,							<--- ONLY REQUIRED IF DOOR IS TRUE: This says how many pixels from the left the player should end up.
	"tpY": 40							<--- ONLY REQUIRED IF DOOR IS TRUE: This says how many pixels from the top the player should end up.
